File permissions is basically the level of access a user/group/others have in relation to your files or directory.

-rw-r--r-- 1 userhacsa userhacsa 70 Oct 14 10:00 script.sh

 -  This first dash indicates that script.sh is a file.

rw- Means the user (file owner) of script.sh has read(r) and write(w) permission but not execute(x) permission. So the - in the
    rw- stands for no execute permission.

r-- The two dashes (--) represents no write and execute permission for group. Group only has read permission, they can only view 
     the script file. 

r-- Also means that the others can only read (view) the file. They cannot modify or run the script file.   

1 Means there is only one copy of the file script.sh

The first userhacsa represents the owner of the file.
The second userhacsa represnts the group the file is associated with

70 represnts the size of the file

Oct 14 10:00 is the day it was last modified
