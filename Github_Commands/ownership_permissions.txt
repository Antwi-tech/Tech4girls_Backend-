File ownership refers to the type/limit of access on has to a file.You can check permission of a file using ls -l filename

Read- This allows a user to view the file only.
Write- This allows one to make modifications to the file.
Execute- Allows the user to run code or run the file as a program.


Permission is basically applied using change mode (chmod) command together with the type of user plus +/- or numbers plus the name of the file

With the use of Numbers:
7 represents all 3 permissions (r , w, x)
4 represents the read permission (r)
2 represents the write command (w)
1 represents the Execute command (x)

Assuming I have a file called Antwi.txt;

If exeucute chmod 735 Antwi.txt , it means the owner being represented by the first number 7 , has all the 3 permissions, the 
group represented by the secind number has only write and exeucute (2 + 1 = 3) permissions and others represented by the last letter
has read and exeucute permissions (4 + 1 = 5)

If I execute chmod 777 Antwi.txt , it means all 3 Groups of users(owner, group , others) can read , write and exeucute the file.

    With the use of Symbols:
    1. + means adding a type of permission 
    2. - means removing a type of permission 
    3. o stands for others
    4. g stands for group
    5. u stands for user

     Example
     chmod u+x Antwi.txt allows the user access to execute the file
     chmod u-w Antwi.txt removes access for the user to modify the file
