Branching in git helps a user to create a user to create a replica of another branch in order to work in the duplicated branch
to avoid too many errors that a code can create in the main branch. It keeps the main branch clean and makes projects effective.

In a collaboration, it allows other collaborators or the owner to make changes to a work without affecting the actual work (main branch).

Sone porpular branches are :
1. Feature Branching - To develop new features
2. Bug fix branch - Fix bugs in code 
3. Development branch -Integrate  features and reloved bugs
