1. Absolute path is a path that contains, the sequential parent directory to your targeted directory separated by forward slash.
   To do this, you need the use the change directory command once to navigate to your targeted directory

Example
    Tech4Girls directory is the parent of gitandgithub directory which is the parent of myfolder directory.If my targeted path is 
    myfolder, The absolute path will be ** cd Tech4Girls/gitandgithub/myfolder**. But if my targeted path is gitandgithub, my absolute path
    will just be **Tech4Girls/gitandgithub**.  

2. Relative paths are paths that can only be accessed from a parent directory.This means moving to the child of the parent directory.
   To do this, you need the use the change directory command more than once plus the child directory you want to go in.

Example
   Using the previus example, gitandgithub is the child and myfolder is the grandchild of Tech4Girls.
   So my targeted folder is myfolder but I need to move step my step:
   a. cd Tech4Girls
   b. cd gitandgithub
   c. cd myfolder

   With the abouve steps, you will even see an absolute path beside the commandline prompt one command after the other.
